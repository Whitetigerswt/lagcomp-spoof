Lagcomp-Extension
=============

Hack client side SA-MP to allow for OnPlayerWeaponShot and GetPlayerLastShotVectors work for servers with lagcomp off, Clients must install this into their game and it cannot be done from server-side.


Download
-------------
Download compiled version here: https://github.com/Whitetigerswt/lagcomp-Extension/releases/
and have your players start using it too, then OnPlayerWeaponShot and GetPlayerLastShotVectors will work no matter if lagcomp is on or off.
